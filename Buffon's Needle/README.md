## Buffon's Needle:

A very famous problem called the *Buffon’s Needle* was posed by French mathematician, and cosmologist Conte de Buffon. He proposed the problem as follows:

  - Lets suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two strips?

Buffon's needle was the earliest problem in geometric probability to be solved; it can be solved using integral geometry. The solution for the sought probability {\p}, in the case where the needle length l is not greater than the width t of the strips, is:

What’s fascinating is the relation between the problem proposed and the mathematical constant π. The value of π can be estimated by re-arranging the equation. The probability of intersection, P, is defined as the number of intersections by the total number of tosses of the needle.

Now to the problem at hand - the probability that the needle will touch either of the lines is given by the solution as follows:
