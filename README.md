# Sticks and Stuff

This repository contains Python simulations of classical/interesting mathematical problems, especially problems that I had come across when I did this course on Probability theory, [EE3110: Probability Foundations for Electrical Engineers](https://courses.iitm.ac.in/course/view.php?id=498), during the Fall of 2021. 

1. Broken Sticks and Triangles - a classic problem from Probability Theory.
2. Buffon's Needle - an interesting application of this problem is in estimating the value of Ï€ 
3. Gambler's Ruin - a nice application of Markov's Chain
