# Sticks and Stuff

This repository contains Python simulations of classical/interesting mathematical problems, especially problems that I had come across when I did this course on Probability theory, EE3110: Probability Foundations for Electrical Engineers, during the Fall of 2021. 

1. Broken Sticks and Triangles - a classic problem from Probability Theory.
2. Buffon's Needle - an interesting application of this problem is in estimating the value of π 
3. Gambler's Ruin using Markov Chains
4.
